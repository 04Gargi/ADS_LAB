# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

This repository contains implementations of fundamental **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in **Java**, created as part of my coursework and practice exercises.  
Each module focuses on a specific concept — from searching and sorting to trees, graphs, and hash maps — implemented with clarity and modularity.
